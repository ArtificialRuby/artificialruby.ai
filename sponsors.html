      Sublayer is a company of builders who teach. Their writing and tutorials share what actually works; their coaching brings it into your code; and they are the primary organizer of the Artificial Ruby meetups in New York City. They turn hard-won patterns into productsâ€”from internal utilities to products you can actually use. The result is an adoption engine: faster learning, fewer dead ends, and a repeatable path from first experiments to shipped AI-native software.
